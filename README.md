# weather-unicorn-hat
weather conditions scrolling on unicorn hat/phat

mytemp.py will pull the weather conditions from the API darksky 
https://darksky.net/dev/docs
you need to register and get the API key (it's free)

The data will be saved on a file txt (temp.txt).

text.py reads the text file and displays on the unicorn phat/hat the text.
